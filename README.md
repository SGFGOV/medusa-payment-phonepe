```
You need to add the plugin into your medusa-config.js as shown below

```
const plugins = [
  ...,
  {
    resolve:`medusa-payment-phonepe`,
  

   options: {
                redirectUrl: "http://localhost:8000/api/payment-confirmed",
                callbackUrl: "http://localhost:9000/phonepe/hook",
                salt: process.env.PHONEPE_SALT,
                merchantId:
                    process.env.PHONEPE_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT,
                mode: process.env.PHONEPE_MODE,
                redirectMode: "POST"
            }
  
  },
  ...]
```
you can replace http://localhost:8000 with your http(s)://your-client-domain
you can replace http://localhost:9000 with your http(s)://your-server-hook
## Client side configuration


For the nextjs start you need to  make the following changes 

1. Create a route to handle post requests from phone pe by creating a route under
  /app/api/payment-confirmed/route.ts

in that add the following code 

```
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars */
/* eslint-disable require-jsdoc */
import { medusaClient } from "@lib/config";
import { createPostCheckSumHeader } from "@lib/util/phonepe-create-post-checksum-header";

export async function POST(
    request: NextRequest,
    _response: NextResponse

    const urlSplit = request.url.split("//");
    const base = urlSplit[1].split("/")[0];

    const data = await request.formData();

    const receivedChecksum = data.get("checksum");
    const merchantTransactionId = data.get("transactionId");
    const code = data.get("code");
    const merchantId = data.get("merchantId");

    let verificationData = "";

    let cartId = merchantTransactionId?.valueOf() as string;
    const cartIdParts = cartId.split("_");
    cartId = `${cartIdParts[0]}_${cartIdParts[1]}`;
    console.log(`computed cart id: ${cartId} `);
    let redirectPath: string | undefined;
    const redirectErrorPath = `/cart`;

    if (
        code?.valueOf() == PaymentStatusCodeValues.PAYMENT_SUCCESS ||
        code?.valueOf() == PaymentStatusCodeValues.PAYMENT_INITIATED
    ) {
        if (!merchantTransactionId?.valueOf() || !merchantId?.valueOf()) {
            notFound();
        } else if (code?.valueOf() != PaymentStatusCodeValues.PAYMENT_SUCCESS) {
            console.log("invalid code", code?.valueOf());
        } else {
            data.forEach((value, key) => {
                if (key != "checksum") verificationData += value;
            });

            const { checksum } = createPostCheckSumHeader(
                verificationData,
                process.env.PHONEPE_SALT,

            if (checksum == checksumReceived || !process.env.TEST_DISABLED) {
                if (checksum != receivedChecksum?.valueOf()) {
                    console.warn("running in test mode.. This is dangerous!! ");
                }

                try {

                                    );

                                orderId = orderCompleted.order.id;
